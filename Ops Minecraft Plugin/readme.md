# OPS MC Plugin

## What is it??
OPS plugin is a funny plugin that I made that kicks out a random player with a funny kick message in minecraft.

## How to use it??
Download the source code, compile it and export it as a `.jar` and then load the `.jar` into the `\Plugin` folder of your server/host machine. Once you've done this restart the
server and type `/ops` in chat, it should pick a random connected user and kick him from the game.
